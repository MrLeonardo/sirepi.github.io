Again a quick and dirty tutorial about how to make a game object face the mouse, and shoot bullets and show a muzzle flash as timed events, without using timers or threads.
Just download the sample project (to be extracted inside a vanilla Duality project) {% include file_download.html file='2015-07-22-bullets-flash.zip' text='here' %}.
